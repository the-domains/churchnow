            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>10 Predictions About the Future Church and Shifting Attendance Patterns - Carey Nieuwhof</h1><p>Every generation experiences change. But sometimes you sense you're in the midst of truly radical change, the kind that happens only every few centuries. Increasingly, I think we're in such a moment now. Those of us in in Western culture who are over age 30 were born into a culture that could conceivably still be called Christian.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/8efac2563cad822a48858515b0c342c7e035a82a.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Don't Try Too Hard to Start a Church. Do This Instead. - V3 Church Planting Movement</h1><p>First the hard part: 90% of start-ups fail. According to one survey, only 68% the church plants make it to four years.* I've planted a church that failed. Ouch. Even though it's been years it still hurts to write that down.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/6d86ef640eb4495cce660c64fdcfc1141674778e.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Inside Hillsong, the Church of Choice for Justin Bieber and Kevin Durant</h1><p>It's the church of choice for Bieber and Durant. It's where the cool kids spend Sunday morning after Saturday night at the club. For ye of little faith, it's hard to make sense out of Hillsong. Is it legit? Is it a hipster cult? And why's everyone wearing Saint Laurent?</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/7461320e57f6af56fb68a19e8cdafde9436127ec.jpg"></article>]]></description>

As well as the usual updates on services, baptisms and weddings, it includes a host of blood-curdling advertisements for upcoming events.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a19170c3fb4419197a0d1c1007a12bb87285b2a6.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>7 types of evangelicals -- and how they'll affect 2016</h1><p>Like many political axioms, though, it papers over a complex reality. But evangelicals rarely vote as a bloc, especially in the primaries. They disagree not only on the candidates but also on more basic principles like how active Christians should be in partisan politics.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/be41eb7b03e9bccc3037b9414c4f209ba24c626d.jpg"></article>]]></description>
