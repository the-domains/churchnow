            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Smart Math of Mixed-Use Development</h1><p>Are cities across the country acting negligently in ignoring the property tax implications of different development types? Joseph Minicozzi thinks so, and he's done the math to prove it. The wisdom of man never yet contrived a system of taxation that would operate with perfect equality. -- Andrew Jackson</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/942bf4abdac3cbf9d016a0982ea0f456019b8abb.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Better Than Church? Exercise as a Spiritual Experience</h1><p>By MaryAnn McKibben Dana, MDiv '03 Last week I caught Tom Ashbrook's show On Point (via podcast). He was talking about the so-called "boutique fitness" trend-exercise classes that promise not only a hard workout but also strong community, and in some cases spiritual enlightenment. The panelists discussed Soul Cycle, CrossFit and other fitness fads.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/c9c2e4517b3a8d1c726bf036726975b23b022685.jpg"></article>]]></description>
