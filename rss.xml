Their storefronts have closed, their gaudy signs spray-painted over in black. In recent months, about a third have left the city of 230,000, situated 18 miles northeast of Dallas. Nobody could be more delighted at their demise than Keith Stewart, senior pastor of Springcreek, Garland's largest church.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/8e96ba1f27682992563a8dc150c22effc1a9f879.jpg"></article>]]></description>

Gray's Baltimore has become notorious as the site of failed "urban renewal" projects, rife with liberal talking points but showing precious little progress in alleviating poverty and joblessness.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/c2448ec7ef29e5e3ed145167191fe7aa32dfc809.jpg"></article>]]></description>
