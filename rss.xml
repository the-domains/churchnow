            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Bono & Eugene Peterson | THE PSALMS</h1><p>This short film documents the friendship between Bono (lead musician of the band U2) and Eugene Peterson (author of contemporary-language Bible translation The Message) revolving around their common interest in the Psalms.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>How the U.S. public became less religious</h1><p>Is the American public becoming less religious? Yes, at least by some key measures of what it means to be a religious person. An extensive new survey of more than 35,000 U.S. adults finds that the percentages who say they believe in God, pray daily and regularly go to church or other religious services all have declined modestly in recent years.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/b13141c76ea6b0081fc8675299ba881491a0bdb5.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Fifty Options for Repurposing Post-Church Church Buildings</h1><p>(RNS) Congregations dwindle. Boilers break. Stained glass shatters. Does this sound like a church in your neighborhood? You're not alone. Congregations across America are shutting their doors due to mergers and closures, graying tithes and delayed maintenance. But don't fear, this means church buildings might actually be used by more than twenty people for one hour on Sunday morning.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/db2a9aff2c9ba871e1fb9c30b4d80f81eb493e31.jpg"></article>]]></description>
