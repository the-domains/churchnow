            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Home</h1><p>The ties that unite a neighborhood help us better tackle and enjoy the myriad of challenges and opportunities we face. The simple goal of National Neighborhood Day is to bring neighbors together and to help enhance neighborhood connections. Neighbors knowing neighbors improves neighborhood connections; connected neighborhoods lead to more effective communities; effective communities strengthen our nation as a whole.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/ab1632bd6ba26a48f8086a76a328d11e63fd9874.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>5 Massive Changes Coming to Your Church (If They're Not Here Already)</h1><p>The good news of Jesus never changes. But the way people receive that news is changing. Fast. Have you ever wondered why virtually every church leader is constantly writing and speaking about change? Including me? Because we live in the fastest-changing culture ever. Change is not just an ocassional reality.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/05b33cc0c92ce0f8dc51f3b1a1c9fc57081b9eaa.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Millennials, Localization, and The New Parish</h1><p>As I've often said on the blog, talking about Millennials and the church is important (and fun!) because what it really serves to do is push the church to ask and answer some really big questions. A more recent, and probably long-term one, is how does the church deal with a generation and world more and more focused on localization?</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/78aa1b17c88348ed91e3e6dae6457826a6ac31f1.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Bono & Eugene Peterson | THE PSALMS</h1><p>This short film documents the friendship between Bono (lead musician of the band U2) and Eugene Peterson (author of contemporary-language Bible translation The Message) revolving around their common interest in the Psalms. Based on interviews conducted by Fuller Seminary faculty member David Taylor and produced in association with Fourth Line Films, the film highlights in particular a conversation on the Psalms that took place between Bono, Peterson, and Taylor at Peterson's Montana home.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/7d34e82d9580f1c6921f3f9757e11e5a04a9fafb.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>How the U.S. public became less religious</h1><p>Is the American public becoming less religious? Yes, at least by some key measures of what it means to be a religious person. An extensive new survey of more than 35,000 U.S. adults finds that the percentages who say they believe in God, pray daily and regularly go to church or other religious services all have declined modestly in recent years.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/b13141c76ea6b0081fc8675299ba881491a0bdb5.jpg"></article>]]></description>
