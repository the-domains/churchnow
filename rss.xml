Their storefronts have closed, their gaudy signs spray-painted over in black. In recent months, about a third have left the city of 230,000, situated 18 miles northeast of Dallas. Nobody could be more delighted at their demise than Keith Stewart, senior pastor of Springcreek, Garland's largest church.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/8e96ba1f27682992563a8dc150c22effc1a9f879.jpg"></article>]]></description>
