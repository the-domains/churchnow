Eucharist. The Holy Mass. But it's a meal that Jesus would have simply called "the Passover." My first experience with the Passover was during my junior year in college, I had decided to fast for a couple of days before Easter as a way of mourning the sadness of Jesus' death.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/09e284d241fae8b96d21cc91e77794b87893274e.jpg"></article>]]></description>
