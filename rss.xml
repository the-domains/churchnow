            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Bono & Eugene Peterson | THE PSALMS</h1><p>This short film documents the friendship between Bono (lead musician of the band U2) and Eugene Peterson (author of contemporary-language Bible translation The Message) revolving around their common interest in the Psalms.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>How the U.S. public became less religious</h1><p>Is the American public becoming less religious? Yes, at least by some key measures of what it means to be a religious person. An extensive new survey of more than 35,000 U.S. adults finds that the percentages who say they believe in God, pray daily and regularly go to church or other religious services all have declined modestly in recent years.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/b13141c76ea6b0081fc8675299ba881491a0bdb5.jpg"></article>]]></description>
