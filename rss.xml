            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Bono & Eugene Peterson | THE PSALMS</h1><p>This short film documents the friendship between Bono (lead musician of the band U2) and Eugene Peterson (author of contemporary-language Bible translation The Message) revolving around their common interest in the Psalms.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>How the U.S. public became less religious</h1><p>Is the American public becoming less religious?
