            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Young, Wrestling, and Always Reforming - Missio Alliance</h1><p>Nearly 500 years ago, The Protestant Reformation unleashed a watershed moment in the evolution of Western Christianity. Drastically affecting the landscapes of Church and society alike, its impact has left an important and undeniable mark upon modern Western culture. However, as the cultural context of Christendom in which the Reformation took shape wanes, the Church finds itself in an unprecedented situation.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/ee5f19dd647b4f90d504061c480e51a9fd448182.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Tiny churches, big hopes: Why some thrive despite the odds - Religion News Service</h1><p>(RNS) Hope, by nature, is defiant, counterintuitive and lodged in surprising places. So a new report detailing the spiritual, demographic and financial challenges faced by small religious congregations meant little to the Rev. Robin Bartlett. She plants her hopes for First Church in Sterling, Mass., on firmer ground.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/1bc52890da662d76d964f4eed4f55e66f5b6185a.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>10 Predictions About the Future Church and Shifting Attendance Patterns - Carey Nieuwhof</h1><p>Every generation experiences change. But sometimes you sense you're in the midst of truly radical change, the kind that happens only every few centuries. Increasingly, I think we're in such a moment now. Those of us in in Western culture who are over age 30 were born into a culture that could conceivably still be called Christian.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/8efac2563cad822a48858515b0c342c7e035a82a.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Don't Try Too Hard to Start a Church. Do This Instead. - V3 Church Planting Movement</h1><p>First the hard part: 90% of start-ups fail. According to one survey, only 68% the church plants make it to four years.* I've planted a church that failed. Ouch. Even though it's been years it still hurts to write that down.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/6d86ef640eb4495cce660c64fdcfc1141674778e.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Inside Hillsong, the Church of Choice for Justin Bieber and Kevin Durant</h1><p>It's the church of choice for Bieber and Durant. It's where the cool kids spend Sunday morning after Saturday night at the club. For ye of little faith, it's hard to make sense out of Hillsong. Is it legit? Is it a hipster cult? And why's everyone wearing Saint Laurent?</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/7461320e57f6af56fb68a19e8cdafde9436127ec.jpg"></article>]]></description>
