            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Better Than Church? Exercise as a Spiritual Experience</h1><p>By MaryAnn McKibben Dana, MDiv '03 Last week I caught Tom Ashbrook's show On Point (via podcast). He was talking about the so-called "boutique fitness" trend-exercise classes that promise not only a hard workout but also strong community, and in some cases spiritual enlightenment. The panelists discussed Soul Cycle, CrossFit and other fitness fads.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/c9c2e4517b3a8d1c726bf036726975b23b022685.jpg"></article>]]></description>
