description: "By MaryAnn McKibben Dana, MDiv '03 Last week I caught Tom Ashbrook's show On Point (via podcast). He was talking about the so-called \"boutique fitness\" trend-exercise classes that promise not only a hard workout but also strong community, and in some cases spiritual enlightenment. The panelists discussed Soul Cycle, CrossFit and other fitness fads."
