  I came across a striking quote recently: "Next to the Blessed Sacrament
  itself, your neighbor is the holiest object presented to your senses." C.S.
  Lewis wrote those words in The Weight of Glory, and, no matter one's religious
  persuasion, it would be difficult to deny that his statement has zing.
